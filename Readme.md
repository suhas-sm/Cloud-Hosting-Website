## What i have learnt By working on this project
1. box-shadow properties.
2. Improved in designing the project

## Honest Time to finish the project

I had took about 40 min. This project made me understand how to make an image as a background (as displaying the whole image). But later i found it looks fine the either way (displaying image partially)
